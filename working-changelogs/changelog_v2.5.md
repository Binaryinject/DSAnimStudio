## PROBABLY GETTING CUT:
* [NOT YET] Right clicking and dragging to move the camera now moves the same relative speed regardless of camera distance from pivot point.
* [NOT YET] New option in `Viewport Config` pane under `DISPLAY`: `Show Camera Pivot Point`, which is self explanatory.
* [NOT YET] New option in `Viewport Config` pane under `DISPLAY`: `Show Grid Origin`, which should be self explanatory.
* [NOT YET] New option `Animation -> Show Root Motion Path`, which renders the root motion path as a line.
* [not yet] There is now a waypoint indicating where on the ground the character was at the start of the last few animations played, so you can measure root motion distance etc.
  * They fade out each time like onion skinning.
* [not yet] You can now drag the bottom-left corner of the model viewer pane to resize the width and height simultaneously.



## Changes/Additions:
* [not done] fbx model import
* [not done] fbx anim import
  * put note about dragging fbx onto main window and also onto the import window itself etc.

## Fixes:
* Popup windows now start in the center of the main application window like intended.
