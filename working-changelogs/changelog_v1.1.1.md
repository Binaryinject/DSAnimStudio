## **Changes/Additions**:
* When an NPC is opened, the draw masks from the default NpcParam are now applied.

## **Bug Fixes**:
* No longer crashes instantly if your system DPI scaling is set to something other than 100%.
* Crashes during application initialization should hopefully show a popup error messagebox now instead of just nothing happening.
