## **Changes/Additions**:
* Animation information banner on top of screen and Edit Anim Info window are both less cryptic. ![Image of new GUI.](https://i.imgur.com/noHr0hW.png)
* New option `File -> Reload GameParam`. Reloads the GameParam from the current game and applies changes to hitboxes etc.

## **Fixes**:
* Edit Anim Info window now correctly named "Edit Anim Info" instead of "Edit Animation Properties".
* Adjusting anim references in the Edit Anim Info window now correctly loads the right animation to play when you click "Keep Changes" rather than requiring you to re-click the animation in the animation list on the left of the screen afterward.
